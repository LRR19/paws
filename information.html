        <p><strong>When is dinner?</strong><br>
            Most experts recommend feeding your dog twice a day — once in the morning and once in the evening — though
            puppies under five months of age should be fed three to four times a day, or as directed by your
            veterinarian.<br>
            While most dogs will dig in the moment you place the bowl on the floor, you may find that your adopted dog
            is a finicky eater, at least at first. After all, he’s been thrust into a new home with new people, and he
            may be too nervous to eat. If this is the case, you will need to teach him to eat on a schedule.<br>
            Leave the bowl on the floor for ten minutes and then pick it up, regardless of whether he has eaten.
            (If your dog is a slow eater, this period can be extended to twenty minutes, but only if he is still eating
            during that time and hasn’t gone off in search of other entertainment.)<br>
            At the next scheduled feeding time, put the bowl back down, again for only ten minutes. Pretty soon your
            dog will learn that he needs to eat when the food is offered.<br>
            Having regularly-scheduled feeding times not only establishes a routine, it also allows you to monitor your
            dog’s health. If he picks at his food throughout the day, you may not notice right away if he’s not eating well.
            But if he normally eats heartily as soon as you put the bowl down, you will immediately see a sudden lack of
            appetite, which is often an indication that he’s not feeling well. If your dog’s appetite doesn’t improve in
            a few days, have him checked by your veterinarian.<br>
            Another benefit of set feedings is that a dog who eats on a schedule poops on a schedule. In addition, if y
            ou live in an urban area, leaving a bowl of kibble on the ground all day can attract unwanted house guests,
            like cockroaches and mice. It is to everyone’s advantage to keep feeding times regular.

        <p><strong>Wet vs. Dry Food For Cats</strong><br>
            If your cat is in good health and you’re feeding 100% complete and balanced cat foods appropriate for your
            cat’s life stage, there is no wrong answer to this question. Whether you’re feeding wet or dry cat food,
            your cat is getting the nutrition her body needs to support good health.<br>
            It really comes down to your cat’s individual preferences. We admire and respect our cats for their
            independent nature. So think of mealtime as another chance to discover and feed your cat’s uniqueness.<br>
            Does your cat prefer the crunchy texture of dry food? Or the variety of textures available in wet foods?
            Keep in mind that dry cat food offers dental, teeth-cleaning benefits. And the moisture in wet foods helps
            provide your cat with healthy hydration.<br>
            Looking to create an even more exciting mealtime for your cat? Whether you’re feeding wet or dry cat
            food (or both), consider offering your cat’s food in a puzzle feeder that encourages her to “play” with her
            food. And as with any changes to your cat’s diet, be sure to monitor your cat’s weight and adjust food
            amounts accordingly.<br>
            Remember, cats can have broad food preferences and crave variety. If that describes your cat,
            consider offering your cat new tastes and textures. Monitoring your cat’s preferences to wet vs. dry cat
            food and creating new meal experiences with this in mind is another very powerful way to strengthen the
            bond you share.

    <h3 class="h3-text">Rabbit Care</h3>
    <div class="container-scrollbox">
        <p>
            <b>Housing and Exercise</b><br>
            Many people think that rabbits don’t require much room for housing or exercise. Not so! Rabbits have
            powerful hind legs designed for running and jumping. They need plenty of out-of-cage exercise time, as well
            as a cage that allows them to move freely. The minimum recommended cage space for a single rabbit is
            2’ x 2’ x 4’. Although wire-bottom cages are common, they can ulcerate a rabbit’s feet. If you have a wire
            cage, cover the bottom with a piece of wood or corrugated cardboard. Better yet, buy a cage with a floor.<br>
            Your rabbit needs a safe exercise area with ample room to run and jump, either indoors or out. Any outdoor
            area should be fully enclosed by a fence. Never leave a rabbit unsupervised outdoors even for a few minutes!
            Cats, dogs and even predatory birds can easily get around fencing material. Also, rabbits can dig under
            fences and get lost. You can rabbit-proof an indoor area by covering all electrical wires and anything else
            your rabbit is likely to chew. Recommended exercise time for indoor rabbits is several hours per day.<br>

            <b>Diet</b><br>
            The most important component of your rabbit’s diet is grass hay (such as Timothy or Brome), which keeps the
            intestinal tract healthy; feed it free-choice, daily.<br>
            In addition to hay, rabbits are also fed commercial rabbit pellets and fresh, dark green leafy
            vegetables. Until they are fully grown (around 6 months), rabbits can have all the pellets they want. After
            that, assuming the animal is also getting hay and vegetables, pellets should be limited to 1/8 to 1/4 cup per
            day per 5 lbs. body weight. Pellets should be fresh and plain, without seeds, nuts or colored tidbits.
            Fresh water (bottle or bowl) should always be available.<br>

            <b>Litter Training</b><br>
            Rabbits are very clean by nature, and will do their best to keep their living quarters clean. Most rabbits
            will choose one corner of the cage as their bathroom. As soon as your rabbit’s choice is clear, put a
            newspaper- lined litter box in that corner; fill it with Timothy hay (or any other grass hay not alfalfa).
            Pelleted-newspaper litters are also acceptable. If the litter box is changed daily, your rabbit’s home will
            stay fresh and odor-free. Don’t use pine or cedar shavings! The fumes may affect your rabbit’s liver enzymes,
            which can cause problems if the animal needs anesthesia for surgery. Avoid using clay cat litters (both clumping
            and non-clumping); these may result in respiratory or gastrointestinal problems.<br>

            <b>Indoors or Outdoors?</b><br>
            Many people think an outdoor hutch is the best way to keep a domestic rabbit. Rabbits, however, are highly
            social animals, and a backyard hutch forces them to live in unnatural isolation. Furthermore, rabbits can die
            of heart attacks from the very approach of a predator or vandal. Domestic rabbits do best indoors where they
            have plenty of interaction with family members.<br>

            <b>Handling and General Care</b><br>
            Pick up your rabbit by supporting his forequarters with one hand and his hindquarters with the other—failure
            to do so can result in spinal injuries to the rabbit. Never pick up a rabbit by his ears; this can cause very
            serious injury.<br>
            Brush your rabbit regularly with a soft brush to remove excess hair and keep his coat in good condition.
            Ask your veterinarian how to clip your rabbit’s nails.<br>
            Rabbits should be spayed or neutered by a veterinarian experienced with rabbit surgeries. Spaying or
            neutering prevents breeding, spraying (males) and uterine cancer (females).<br>
            Rabbits should not be housed with other rabbits unless all are spayed/neutered and they are introduced in
            neutral territory under careful supervision. Introductions are often difficult and injuries can result.<br>
            If your rabbit stops eating or moving his bowels for 12 hours or longer or has watery diarrhea, seek expert
            veterinary care immediately.

    <h3 style="padding: 10px">Myths About Adopting a Pet</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Shelter animals are damaged goods and come with behavior issues or medical challenges.
            <ul>
                <li>FACT: many animals enter shelters because an owner has had to give them up due to relocation,
                    financial hardships or health problems.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>All shelter animals are old and won’t bond with their adopter.
            <ul>
                <li>FACT: Shelters often have a variety of animals of different breeds, sizes and ages. Age is not a
                    determining factor in an animal’s affection toward humans or its ability to bond with them.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Shelters mainly have mixed breeds and don’t have purebred animals available for adoption.
            <ul>
                <li>FACT: Animal populations differ from shelter to shelter.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Getting animals from a breeder is safer because breeders know the animal’s bloodline and family history.
            <ul>
                <li>FACT: As a result of their breeding, purebred dogs very often have genetic disorders and medical
                    issue predispositions, certainly no less often than shelter dogs.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Adoption fees are too expensive and the adoption process is too difficult.
            <ul>
                <li>FACT: Requirements, policies and procedures vary depending on the adoption center or rescue group you’re looking to adopt from.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
